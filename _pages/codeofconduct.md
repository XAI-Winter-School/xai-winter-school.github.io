The organizers of this school are firmly committed to combating all forms of discrimination, whether based on ethnic, national, or social origin, physical characteristics, sex, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or any other grounds. In accordance with current regulations, discriminatory behavior, harassment, abuse of authority, and acts of retaliation are strictly prohibited during this event and will not be tolerated.

The organizers also wish to remind participants that explicit or implicit hierarchies within the research community can sometimes make it difficult to express discomfort. If you believe you are a victim or a witness of discrimination or harassment during the school, you are encouraged to contact the organizers directly or by email at causalxaiscai@gmail.com. Sexual harassment and moral harassment are criminal offenses under the law. We are committed to responding firmly to inappropriate behavior and to reporting such incidents to the relevant authorities, who will determine any potential legal action.
